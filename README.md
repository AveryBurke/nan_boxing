# NaN Boxing Demo

This is a simple demonstration of the NaN Boxing implementation described in my blog post [Dynamic Typing and NaN Boxing](https://averyburke.github.io/blog/2023/08/23/Nan-Boxing.html). 

NaN boxing is an optimization in dynamically typed languages to store type data and value data together, at runtime, by exploiting some features of the [IEEE specification for NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). It turns out the specification leaves 51 mantissa bits that get ignored when a double is detected to be Not a Number. NaN boxing works by storing the type and the value of a parsed token in those overlooked bits. Essentially every value is a double and every non-double is NaN.

I use the three most significant digits of the 51 mantissa bits to store type data. The three bit type data is also referred to as a *tag*. The remaining 48 digits store the value data. I will refer to this as the *payload*. Since modern architectures only use the lower 48 bits of a 64 bit pointer, the payload can even hold pointers.

## Features

This implementation supports three types: `float`, `int` and `string`. The repl will try to first parse a float, if successful it will test if the float can be represented as a 32 bit int. Otherwise it will treat the token as a string.

### Floats

With NaN boxing you get floats for free. So if a token can be parsed as a float nothing more needs to be done.

### Ints

This implementation uses 32 bit ints. An int is encoded by tagging a NaN as an int and directly encoding the intâ€™s bits into the payload. An int is decoded by masking the 32 bits from the tagged NaN, truncating the masked payload and casting the result as an int32_t.

### strings

A parsed string is first copied to the heap. Then a pointer to the new address is encoded into a tagged NaN. Strings are decoded by masking the 48 bit payload and casting the result to a char pointer


## Dependencies

You will need [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed if you want to build and test the project. You can also simply run the REPL from the binary

## Usage

Start the REPL with `./repl` or with `just run`. Enter expressions and watch as they are evaluated right before your eyes!

```lisp
$> (+ 8 -8 .1234)
type: string, value: (
type: string, value: +
type: int, value: 8
type: int, value: -8
type: float, value: 0.123400
type: string, value: )
```

Run tests with `just test`.
